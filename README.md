# 🚦 AI-Powered Perpetrator Identification in Road Accidents  
## 🔍 An AI-driven system for identifying vehicles involved in hit-and-run accidents  

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=AI+Perpetrator+Detection)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered computer vision system** that **detects, identifies, and acknowledges** vehicles involved in **hit-and-run accidents** using **machine learning and IoT integration**. The goal is to assist **law enforcement, insurance companies, and city traffic authorities** by automating **real-time perpetrator detection** from **CCTV/dashcam footage**.  

🔹 **Detects vehicles and pedestrians in accident footage**  
🔹 **Recognizes license plates using AI-powered OCR**  
🔹 **Generates real-time alerts for authorities**  
🔹 **Supports IoT-based traffic safety enforcement (optional)**

## 🎯 Key Features  
### 🚗 Hit-and-Run Detection  
- Uses **YOLOv8** for real-time **vehicle & pedestrian detection**.  
- Identifies **hit-and-run scenarios** by analyzing accident frames.  
- Logs **vehicle details (type, speed, location)** from video.  

### 🚦 License Plate Recognition  
- Extracts license plate details using **OpenALPR**.  
- Compares detected plates with **blacklisted/stolen vehicle databases**.  
- Integrates with **law enforcement alert systems**.  

### 🏥 Automated Emergency Alerts  
- Sends **real-time notifications** to authorities.  
- Can be linked to **traffic light control systems** to halt perpetrators.  
- Provides **forensic evidence** (video + AI-processed metadata).  

### 🛑 Preventive Safety Measures (IoT-Enhanced)  
- Monitors **reckless driving behavior** (harsh braking, swerving).  
- Detects **over-speeding near schools & hospitals**.  
- Can be integrated with **smart traffic systems for automated enforcement**.
